Hello World!

# Henry comments 13/April
- Not enough commits + changelog items to pass at this frequency.
- I couldn't find your text-based data. Create a root folder "data/" and put all your JSON files in there.
- You're still missing a licenses.txt + changelog.md file.

# YONGXIN XIE comments 20/April
- Missing files have been added
- Have been really busy during the last few weeks, will catch up the progress next.
- My apology

# Henry comments 27/April
- This file still needs compile instructions, and directory explanation so I know where to find stuff.
- I'm not sure how to run your project from this directory.
- Your changelog needs a lot of work
- Your data hasn't progressed enough. You need to get to this very quickly, as you can't start building your game until you can at least load the levels/world of your game. So work on getting loading working (from data files) asap.
